## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Cassandra Analyzer. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [documentation](README.md)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Check the [discussions](https://github.com/axonops/cassandra-analyzer/discussions)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/axonops/cassandra-analyzer/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/axonops/cassandra-analyzer/issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Cassandra Analyzer) or was this always a problem?
* **If the problem started happening recently**, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Cassandra Analyzer? What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* **What's your environment?** (OS, Python version, AxonOps version, etc.)

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks

### Python Styleguide

The project follows a relaxed version of [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to maintain compatibility with existing code.

#### Current Approach

Due to the existing codebase, we use relaxed linting rules. For new code, please follow these guidelines:

* **Line length**: Up to 120 characters (instead of 80)
* **Imports**: Group imports logically (stdlib, third-party, local)
* **Naming**: Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
* **Docstrings**: Add docstrings to new functions and classes

#### Linting

The project uses flake8 with relaxed rules. To check your code:

```bash
# This will use the .flake8 config with relaxed rules
flake8 cassandra_analyzer
# Or
make lint
```

#### Future Goals

While we currently have relaxed formatting rules to preserve the existing codebase, we aim to gradually improve code quality. When modifying existing code:

* Fix obvious issues (like syntax errors)
* Don't reformat entire files
* Focus on the specific lines you're changing

For entirely new files, you're encouraged to use stricter formatting:

```bash
# For new files only
black path/to/new/file.py
isort path/to/new/file.py
```

### Test Styleguide

* **Follow TDD** - Write tests first, then implementation
* Use descriptive test names
* Each test should test one thing
* Use pytest fixtures for common setup
* Aim for 100% code coverage for new code
* Mock external dependencies (AxonOps API calls)

Example test structure:

```python
def test_should_identify_high_cpu_usage_when_above_threshold():
    # Arrange
    analyzer = InfrastructureAnalyzer()
    metrics = create_test_metrics(cpu_usage=85.0)
    
    # Act
    recommendations = analyzer.analyze(metrics)
    
    # Assert
    assert len(recommendations) == 1
    assert recommendations[0].severity == "HIGH"
    assert "CPU usage" in recommendations[0].description
```

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)
* Reference functions using the full path (e.g., `cassandra_analyzer.analyzers.infrastructure.analyze()`)
* Use docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules
* Include examples in docstrings where appropriate

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

* `bug` - Something isn't working
* `enhancement` - New feature or request
* `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
* `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
* `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
* `invalid` - This doesn't seem right
* `question` - Further information is requested
* `wontfix` - This will not be worked on
* `duplicate` - This issue or pull request already exists

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
4. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
5. Create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality. The hooks are configured to be minimal and non-intrusive, focusing on catching common issues without enforcing strict formatting that would change existing code.

#### What the pre-commit hooks check:

- **YAML/JSON/TOML syntax** - Ensures configuration files are valid
- **Large file detection** - Prevents accidentally committing large files
- **Merge conflict markers** - Catches unresolved merge conflicts
- **Debug statements** - Finds forgotten debug print/breakpoint statements
- **Flake8 (relaxed rules)** - Basic Python linting with many rules disabled

#### Troubleshooting pre-commit issues:

**Error: "failed to find interpreter for Builtin discover of python_spec='python3.11'"**

This happens when pre-commit is configured for a different Python version than what's installed on your system.

Solution:
```bash
# Check your Python version
python3 --version

# If you see Python 3.12 or another version, the pre-commit config has been updated
# to work with any Python 3.x version. Clean and reinstall:
pre-commit clean
pre-commit install
```

**Error: Black/isort wants to reformat all files**

The project currently has relaxed formatting rules to avoid changing existing code. Black and isort are disabled in the pre-commit configuration. If you want to use them locally:

```bash
# Format your new code only (not recommended for existing files)
black --check path/to/your/new/file.py
isort --check-only path/to/your/new/file.py
```

**Error: Flake8 is too strict**

The project uses a `.flake8` configuration file with relaxed rules. If you're still getting too many errors:

1. Make sure flake8 is using the config file:
   ```bash
   flake8 --config=.flake8 cassandra_analyzer
   ```

2. The following rules are already ignored:
   - Line length (up to 120 characters)
   - Whitespace issues (W291, W292, W293)
   - Unused imports (F401)
   - Various formatting preferences (E128, E501, E129, E303, etc.)

**Temporarily skip pre-commit hooks** (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
```

**Run pre-commit manually on all files:**
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Run pre-commit on staged files only:**
```bash
pre-commit run
```

**Update pre-commit hooks to latest versions:**
```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=cassandra_analyzer --cov-report=html
```
